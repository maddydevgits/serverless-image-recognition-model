Official Repo of my work for Serverless Image Recognition Model 

# Softwares
1. VS Code
2. Python3
3. Postman
4. Node.Js

# Process
Here's a step-by-step guide for the entire process in Python:

1. Create a Python script for the Lambda function that will process the image like lambda_handler.py
2. Create the AWS Lambda function and upload the script:
3. Create the AWS API Gateway:
4. Send a test image to the API using Postman:
5. Create a new POST request.

The image data will be passed to the Lambda function, which will pass it to AWS Rekognition for analysis. The results of the analysis will be returned in the response.
